## uSkizzik's Tetris

This is a Tetris clone played entirely in the CLI.  
It's a quick side project done out of boredom that tries following the Tetris guidelines.

One Thursday (10/12/2023) I was bored in programming class and decided to make a Tetris clone. 
Initially, I wanted to work on it only during school in programming classes, however I ended up finishing it over the weekend.

This is a quick and dirty side-project. It's not meant to be performant, it's not meant to be easily maintainable.
I didn't spend a lot of time cleaning up code because it won't be developed further. 
I also tried using a lot of different concepts to exercise myself and learn how exactly they work in C# (because I'm primarily a webdev).

I used the [Tetris Guideline](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline) as a reference while making this clone.
I didn't do everything the way Tetris recommends, however I did my best to recreate the rules set by the guideline.
